**Rationale**

When it comes to cooking, many people often struggle to come up with new and exciting recipes using the ingredients they have on hand. They may find themselves limited by their culinary knowledge or simply lack inspiration. Research studies have shown that having a variety of recipes and cooking techniques at their disposal can help individuals expand their cooking skills and enhance their overall dining experiences.

**Problem**

The problem we are addressing is the difficulty people face in creating unique and delicious recipes using the ingredients they have available. This challenge is compounded by the fact that individuals may not have a comprehensive understanding of different flavor combinations or cooking methods. As a result, they may feel stuck in a culinary rut, preparing the same dishes repeatedly or resorting to basic, uninspiring meals.

**Solution**

Our solution is a Custom Recipe Generator, an app that leverages the power of artificial intelligence and culinary knowledge to help users create customized recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. The Custom Recipe Generator provides a user-friendly platform for individuals to discover new and exciting recipes that suit their taste preferences and available ingredients.

3. **Step-by-Step Instructions:** Each recipe comes with detailed step-by-step instructions, making it easy for users to follow along and prepare the dish with confidence. The instructions include cooking times, temperature settings, and helpful tips to ensure a successful cooking experience.

4. **Nutritional Information:** The app provides nutritional information for each recipe, including calorie count, macronutrient breakdown, and allergen information, helping users make informed choices that align with their dietary goals and restrictions.
